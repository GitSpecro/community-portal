        <h2 style="color: #3D348B;">Our Story</h2>
        <p class="text-muted mt-3">
          Creative Grounds began as a small vision to create more than just events. We dreamed of building safe spaces —
          vibrant, expressive spaces — where young people could unleash their creative potential, connect deeply, and gain direction.
          Through every paint stroke, every beat dropped, and every tech breakthrough, our events became healing grounds.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted">
          We believe that creativity is not a luxury — it's a lifeline. For the dreamer who doesn’t know where to start,
          for the artist who hasn’t found their voice, and for the youth who needs encouragement — Creative Grounds is home.

    <h2 style="color: #FF595E;">Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="text-muted mt-3">
      To ignite purpose and possibility in young people by providing spaces where they can explore, express, and evolve through creative disciplines.
      We aim to host events that offer not just exposure — but encouragement, mentorship, direction, and a sense of belonging.
      We hope each Creative Grounds experience becomes a launchpad for goals, healing, growth, and lifelong community.
